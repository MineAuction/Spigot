# MineAuction
## Info
Java part of MineAuction plugin, which should have been mostly based on old WebAuctionPlus plugin. However our plugin should have provided more configuration ways at both java and web side.

## CANCELED
MineAuction project has been canceled. Core features that should be pillars of this creation could not be achieved in Bukkit/Spigot. We might rework this idea entirely in future, but don't rely on that.
